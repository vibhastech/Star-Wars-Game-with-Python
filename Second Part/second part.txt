Second Part:
Inherit the “Turtle” from the “turtle” module into a class named “Ankur”. Initialize with the function __init__(self). Then, set the initializer as the turtle. Likewise, set the speed to 0 and pick the pen up as we are not ready to draw.
class Ankur(turtle.Turtle):
    def __init__(self):
        turtle.Turtle.__init__(self)

        self.speed(0)
        self.penup()
Coming out of the function, create a function(ankur1) with the parameters “t1” and “t2”. Inside this function, set the current x coordinate into the variable x1 and the y coordinate into y1. Then, do the same with the t2 and “x2”, “y2”. Similarly, set the arctangent of “y1-y2” and “x1-x2” into “taauko” with the math module. Again, multiply the “taauko” with “180.0 / 3.14159” and return “taauko”.
def ankur1(t1, t2):
    x1 = t1.xcor()
    y1 = t1.ycor()
    
    x2 = t2.xcor()
    y2 = t2.ycor()
    
    taauko = math.atan2(y1 - y2, x1 - x2)
    taauko = taauko * 180.0 / 3.14159
    
    return taauko
Create an object named “player” from the Ankur() class. Then, set the color to white and the shape to “player”. Declare the score of the player object to 0.
player = Ankur()
player.color("white")
player.shape("player")
player.score = 0
